# JS-ToDo-List
a to do list I coded in JavaScript

this to-do list is quite incomplete because it doesn't have the function to remember
the list of tasks you gave if you leave or refresh the page

In other words, I had no idea how to save the list to localStorage

I know how to use localStorage but or this kind of thing, I don't even know how to store it

I only know how to use the localStorage but simple things like text and value

What this darling demands is something I could not accomplish

So in the end, I have up on using localStorage and completed the to-do list

Howvever, like I said, if you leave the page pr refresh it, the list will be lost

I'll learn how to apply localStorage to it later

I know one day I'll be able to do it

anyways,

you can edit the code and request a pull from me

if you can make the code apply localStorage, I would defenitely accept the pull request after taking a look at the edited code
